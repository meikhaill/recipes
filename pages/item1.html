      <h4>Requirements include</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Can of your favorite baked beans! (refried works as well.)</li>
            <li>A bowl! but if you're eating this you probably cant afford a bowl so your hands work too!</li>
            <li>Milk! Expired milk will add an added kick to each bite!(optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is a very simple recipe that will have you up and ready to go in no time. </p>
        <h5>NOTE!!! Cook time: 4-5 minutes</h5>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol type="1">
            <li>Open your favorite can of baked beans, brand name will not matter here, but make sure you give it a good mix before doing anything else. Give the beans time to rest.</li>
            <li>Grab your milk out of the fridge as well as a bowl. This will be the most important step as we would just simply be eating normal beans without. <strong>NOT OPTIONAL</strong></li>
            <li>Lastly, combine both beans and milk, stir thoroughly and let sit for 1-2 minutes. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
